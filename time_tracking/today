            Blinn-Phong material support 
            Oren-Nayer material support 
            ... 
            take them from cgv 
        Meshing, TexturedMeshRenderer
            ok-load mesh, read its mtl files to load images, only pic dirs enough 
                -> load file, load its textures automatically 
            ok-bind a list of images, we have to know their name?
            ok-gui binding 

            parallel loading 
            support mesh with more than one materials 
                binding with diff. materials when rendering, use more vaos to support this? 
                similar to multiple meshes.. multiple vaos, multiple vertex arrays 
            load with openmesh? 
            switch per-vertex color  
            append meshes 
            [+] realistic rendering of meshes, openmesh support, direct vertex submit (beter than understanding simple_mesh?)
                material loading too complex! 
            load mesh from dir 

        ok-TessellationShaderTest_NormalRenderer or normal support  
            render normal taken from NS repo 

        ok-BoxRenderer 
            ok-how did they render a box? 5
            ok-prob: looks not good, add light, lighting solved 
            give roations and transformations at vertex shader 

            [-] cgv shader system is mature 
                material support 
                matrix computation ref. cgv 

        ok-SurfelRenderer 
            emit vertices in normal space 
        other renderers can be imported later

        developed a framwork with nanogui/ nse 
            binded with openvr and openxr 
            load meshes with multiple materials 
            which benefits our future research 
            our own way of mesh rendering
