* Point Cloud Merging:
    * Merged building scale point cloud 
* Surface Reconstruction:
    * Tried the code from the paper: Instant Field-Aligned Meshes after reading the paper “The Replica Dataset: A Digital Replica of Indoor Spaces”
        * Does not support reading from point clouds originally, the algorithm supports
    * Found a fork that supports this, not working well as the following one 
    * Tried the code from the paper: Field-aligned online surface reconstruction
        * Works with small scene, takes too long time for large scene reconstruction 
        * Has a relative good mesh and visual effect, texture re-projection may be supported 
    * Worked for my thesis, a better GUI made

    * Selective LOD Rendering of my point clouds made, sub and super sampling

* Texture Reconstruction:
    * Familiar with the software: Reality Capture

        * Actually does not support texture re-projection, only supports from one model to an other, not what we need 
    * Prepare .e57 file with correct header, feed to RC
        * // Point cloud can not be loaded to RC after external edit, camera positions missing 
        * Tried to cure this issue with pye57 library, failed 
        * Tried to solve this problem with libe57Format, built successfully but the load of point clouds from sketch too complex, give up 
        * Tried to modify the source code of the software: CloudCompare, load camera positions from external file, success  

* Literature Review
* Working hours: 10
